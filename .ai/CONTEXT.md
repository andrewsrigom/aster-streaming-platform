# Persistent Project Context

## Product

Aster is a video-on-demand platform for openly licensed films. Its initial value is a reliable browsing and playback experience backed by a rights-aware content pipeline.

## Current implementation state

Phases 00–04 are released. Guarded local sessions/profiles, rights-aware Catalog and Apollo Router run in Docker with protected/post-merge acceptance. Generated HLS proves Catalog publication, not playback. Public Next.js SSR, opt-in synthetic seed and local profile/Redux flows pass focused and real browser checks; complete Web acceptance and playable journeys remain unfinished. ADR-0018 scopes the exact browser origin and disposable private Apollo cache. Compatible licensing decisions remain authorized. Exact progress lives in `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`.

## Fixed boundaries

Primary bounded contexts:

1. Identity and Profiles
2. Catalog
3. Playback
4. Engagement
5. Discovery

Media processing is an asynchronous worker capability that cooperates with Catalog and Playback but does not own editorial title state.

## Target technical baseline

- TypeScript monorepo managed with pnpm and Turborepo
- Next.js App Router web application
- Apollo Client and Redux Toolkit with separate state ownership
- Apollo Router and Federation v2 subgraphs
- Node.js services
- PostgreSQL for durable state
- Redis for cache, rate limiting, request coalescing, and bounded coordination
- Kafka-compatible event broker for domain-event distribution after the outbox phase
- FFmpeg media processing
- S3-compatible object storage and CDN delivery
- OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Tempo, and Loki
- Vitest, Playwright, integration containers, schema checks, and k6

Repository tool versions are selected and pinned in Phase 00. Application, container, and infrastructure dependency versions are selected in the phase that first owns them after current compatibility verification.

## Non-negotiable behavior

- Rights review precedes media publication.
- Application servers do not proxy video segments.
- Playback progress rejects stale and duplicate updates.
- Redis failure cannot corrupt durable product state.
- Optional discovery failure does not block catalog browsing or playback.
- Every public GraphQL operation has bounded cost and execution time.
- Cross-context events are versioned and idempotently consumed.
- Production claims require recorded evidence.

## Delivery state

Active phase: **Phase 05 — Web Shell, SSR, and Hydration**, PR 22 based on released main b6c99c4. Batched license/notice, presentation and lightweight-style corrections have current source/browser/laboratory evidence. Final confirmation and protected publication remain; shared-host timing limits are explicit.

Read `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md` and `.ai/WORK_QUEUE.md` for the exact next action.

PR 21 squash `b6c99c4` and successful post-merge run `33104100966` close Phase 04. Initial CI/review findings and corrections remain recorded in its evidence. No actual film approval or hosted release is claimed. Keep owner-side authorization and prevent local viewer identity from becoming an operator or hosted trust shortcut.
