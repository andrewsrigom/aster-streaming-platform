# Work Queue

Only one item may be `IN_PROGRESS`.

P01-R09 is released through PR 17 squash `a1f7281`; protected run `33041524806` and exact post-merge run `33041787663` pass every applicable gate and the real eight-scenario matrix. P01-R10 starts locally from that clean merge: portable Identity packaging, resource-aware profiles and the clean Docker-only Phase 01 closeout.

The optional-profile checkpoint now passes real metrics, Collector outage isolation/recovery, bounded degraded shutdown and exact nine-service reset. Focused config/Identity/platform/CI checks pass 20/34/29/22. CI image/profile coverage is added. Exact clean source `38801ce` passes Docker-only/occupied-port/reset acceptance, 49/49 uncached tasks and audit. Only publication, protected CI, confirmation and release remain P01-R10 work.

## Work-item rules

- Move one item to `IN_PROGRESS` before changing code.
- `WAITING_EXTERNAL` requires a frozen evidenced candidate and permits only one later dependent local item under the predecessor-first release rule in `AGENTS.md`.
- Record its plan in `.ai/CHANGE_PLAN.md`.
- Do not mark `DONE` without linked evidence.
- Add newly discovered work only if it belongs to the active phase.
- Record future-phase ideas under the relevant specification rather than implementing them early.
- `READY` items after the active item are ordered runway, not authorization to start them concurrently.
