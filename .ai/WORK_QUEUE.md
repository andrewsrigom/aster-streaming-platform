# Work Queue

Only one item may be `IN_PROGRESS`.

Phases 00–02 are released. P03-R01 is committed as 4968d42. P03-R02 rights persistence is locally verified: 61 tests, real PostgreSQL proof and all 52 candidate tasks pass. Next is P03-R06 on feat/p03-catalog-rights. Operator/public API and actual media remain planned.

P02-R09 is complete: [release evidence](../evidence/phase-02/release.txt). P03-R01 has [domain evidence](../evidence/phase-03/catalog-domain.txt); P03-R02 has [persistence evidence and its completed plan](../evidence/phase-03/catalog-persistence.txt). No Phase 03 remote publication or actual-film approval yet.

## Work-item rules

- Move one item to `IN_PROGRESS` before changing code.
- `WAITING_EXTERNAL` requires a frozen evidenced candidate and permits only one later dependent local item under the predecessor-first release rule in `AGENTS.md`.
- Record its plan in `.ai/CHANGE_PLAN.md`.
- Do not mark `DONE` without linked evidence.
- Add newly discovered work only if it belongs to the active phase.
- Record future-phase ideas under the relevant specification rather than implementing them early.
- `READY` items after the active item are ordered runway, not authorization to start them concurrently.
