# Work Queue

Only one item may be `IN_PROGRESS`.

P01-R08 checkpoint (2026-08-27): executable Identity source `282ccb5` passes local acceptance and exact frozen checkout; protected publication/review/release remain. P01-R09 is not active yet.

## Work-item rules

- Move one item to `IN_PROGRESS` before changing code.
- `WAITING_EXTERNAL` requires a frozen evidenced candidate and permits only one later dependent local item under the predecessor-first release rule in `AGENTS.md`.
- Record its plan in `.ai/CHANGE_PLAN.md`.
- Do not mark `DONE` without linked evidence.
- Add newly discovered work only if it belongs to the active phase.
- Record future-phase ideas under the relevant specification rather than implementing them early.
- `READY` items after the active item are ordered runway, not authorization to start them concurrently.
